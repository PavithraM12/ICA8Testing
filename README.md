# ICA8Testing

Problem:

-> No two urinals in sequence not to be occupied.
-> Checking the condition if the string sequence contains 11 together : If exists it should return -1
-> Looping the string of characters and checking that two digits 00 together change the 0 as 1 and increase the count
-> chcking three digits 000 the middle changes to 1 and count increase
-> Code checks for sequence of 0's, if three are 0 in sequence 1 will be replaced and increase the count

-> Now code will return number of zeros can be changed to 1 with displaying the count
